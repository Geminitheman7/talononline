			<p><span class="byline">By Anshuman Venkat, and Pranav Malladi</span> - For years, The Talon has been the go-to source for news and information for the community. But now, the publication is taking its reporting to the next level by going online.</p>
			<p>The move to digital is not only a sign of the times but also an opportunity to expand the reach of The Talon. With an online presence, the publication can now reach a wider audience and share news in real-time.</p>
			<p>One of the benefits of going online is that The Talon can now publish breaking news as it happens. In the past, the publication had to wait until the next print edition to report on breaking news. With the online platform, however, The Talon can now share news as it unfolds, keeping the community informed and up-to-date.</p>
			<p>Another advantage of the digital platform is that The Talon can now offer more in-depth coverage on a variety of topics. With unlimited space, the publication can now dive deeper into issues and provide more context and analysis than ever before.</p>
			<p>Going online also means that The Talon can now offer multimedia content, such as videos and podcasts. This will not only enhance the reader's experience but also offer a new way for the publication to engage with the community.</p>
			<p>But perhaps the biggest advantage of going online is that The Talon can now interact with its readers in real-time. With features such as comments and social media, the publication can now have a two-way conversation with its audience. This will not only foster a sense of community but also help The Talon better understand the needs and interests of its readers.</p>
			<p>Of course, with any change, there will be challenges. One of the biggest challenges The Talon will face is adapting to the new platform. The publication will need to learn how to optimize content for the web, including search engine optimization and social media promotion.</p>
			<p>Another challenge will be monetizing the online platform. While the print edition relies on advertising revenue, the online platform will need to explore new revenue streams, such as sponsored content and subscriptions.</p>
			<p>Overall, however, the move to digital is an exciting development for The Talon and the community it serves. With the new platform, The Talon can now offer more timely, in-depth, and engaging content than ever before, and we can't wait to see what the future holds.</p>
