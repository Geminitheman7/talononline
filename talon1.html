			<p><span class="byline">By Anshuman Venkat, and Pranav Malladi</span> - The Talon is the student-run newspaper at Skyview Middle School, and it has been a staple of the school for many years. However, two 6th-grade students, Anshuman Venkat and Pranav Malladi, are taking The Talon to the next level by bringing it online. This move is an exciting one that will benefit the school and its community in many ways.</p>
			<p>The decision to take The Talon online was a natural one. As the world becomes more digital, it's essential to adapt to these changes and embrace new technologies. By creating an online version of The Talon, Anshuman and Pranav are bringing the school newspaper into the 21st century and making it more accessible to everyone.</p>
			<p>One of the most significant benefits of an online newspaper is its accessibility. With a website, The Talon can reach a broader audience than ever before. Parents, alumni, and community members who might not have had access to the print version can now read the articles from anywhere in the world. This increased visibility can also help the school attract new students and families who are interested in what Skyview has to offer.</p>
			<p>An online newspaper is also more environmentally friendly. By reducing the amount of paper used, Anshuman and Pranav are making a positive impact on the environment. This move shows that Skyview Middle School is committed to sustainability and reducing its carbon footprint.</p>
			<p>Creating an online newspaper is no small feat, but Anshuman and Pranav are up for the challenge. They are working hard to create a website that is easy to navigate and has a modern design. They are also collaborating with the school's IT department to ensure that the website is secure and meets all the necessary standards.</p>
			<p>The online version of The Talon will offer many of the same features as the print version. Readers will still be able to enjoy the school news, sports coverage, opinion pieces, and creative writing. However, an online newspaper also has some unique advantages. For example, The Talon website can include multimedia elements such as videos, podcasts, and interactive graphics. This multimedia content can make the articles more engaging and help readers connect with the stories on a deeper level.</p>
			<p>In conclusion, the move to take The Talon online is an exciting development for Skyview Middle School. Anshuman Venkat and Pranav Malladi are showing leadership and innovation by taking the initiative to create an online version of the school newspaper. By doing so, they are bringing The Talon into the digital age and making it more accessible to a wider audience. We look forward to seeing the new website and reading the articles that Anshuman and Pranav produce.</p>
